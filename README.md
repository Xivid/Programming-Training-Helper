# Programming-Training-Helper
A Django website for sharing solutions and comments for programming problems.

Developed By @yumendy and @Xivid in 2014. We named it SSECTA (SSE C programming language Training Assistant). Our C programming language teacher liked it and adopted it as a training assistant as well as an error reporting platform because there were so many mistakes in the problems in our [online training system](http://sse.hit.edu.cn/train).
